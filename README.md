# ESPressIoT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Schm1tz1/ESPressIoT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Schm1tz1/ESPressIoT)
This project covers somewhat advances features for an espresso machine controller. The basic idea was to have reproducible "espresso results" due to temperature regulation and being able to fine-tune. Especialy small machines have a low heat capacity and quality suffers a lot from different heat-up-times and high hysteresis in standard temperature switches.
This work is based on my previous work with with IoT, MQTT and my small controller [cofcon](https://github.com/Schm1tz1/cofcon). As always - take care, you are working with high voltages and you are switching loads up to a few Kilowatts. Please be sure yo know what you are doing, always disconnect and unplug you machine before installing electronics components, choose your components (cables, connectors, sensors, SSR etc.) wisely...

## Dependencies
* Espresso Machine (Gaggic CC, Rancilio Silvia etc.)
* ESP8266 with [Arduino for ESP8266][1]
* [Arduino-PID-Library][2]
* a suitable temperature sensor (e.g. TSIC 306 - [library here][3])
* a SSR which is capable of switching your heater, has a low trigger threshold and does not draw too much current (otherwise you will toast your ESP8266)
* some electronics skills

## Features
* very fast and accurate adaptive PID-Controller for the heater of your espresso machine (heat-up-time about 2 minutes, stability/RMS of ~0.15 Â°C)
* WWW-Interface for control, configuration and tuning
* MQTT-Interface (needs [PubSub-Client][4])
* OTA-Flash enabled (over-the-air, flash firmware via upload in WWW-Interface)
* Serial Interface for testing, debugging
* JSON-Config in internal SPIFFS (uses [ArduinoJSON][5])
* Re-Written auto-tuning-loop to optimize PID parameters
* integrated simulation to test features and functionality
