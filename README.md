# ESPressIoT-ESP32

This project is a fork of the original ESPressIoT project by Roman
Schmit orignially written for an  ESP3866 board with a TSIC
sensor. This fork ports that code to an ESP32 with a MAX31855
amplified K thermocouple.


The project covers somewhat advances features for an espresso machine
controller. The basic idea was to have reproducible "espresso results"
due to temperature regulation and being able to fine-tune. Especialy
small machines have a low heat capacity and quality suffers a lot from
different heat-up-times and high hysteresis in standard temperature
switches.

This work is based on Roman's previous work with with IoT, MQTT and his
small controller [cofcon](https://github.com/Schm1tz1/cofcon). As
always - take care, you are working with high voltages and you are
switching loads up to a few Kilowatts. Please be sure yo know what you
are doing, always disconnect and unplug you machine before installing
electronics components, choose your components (cables, connectors,
sensors, SSR etc.) wisely...

## Dependencies
* [Arduino-PID-Library v1][1] 
* Espresso Machine (Gaggic CC, Rancilio Silvia etc.)
* ESP32 dev board (I used  the ESP32 NodeMCU Module WLAN WiFi Development Board met CP2102 )
* [ArduinoJSON v6][2]
* a suitable temperature sensor (This code uses the MAX31855 with the
  [Adafruit-MAX31855][3] library)
* [ArduinoStreamUtils][4]
* a SSR which is capable of switching your heater, has a low trigger threshold and does not draw too much current (otherwise you will toast your ESP8266)
* some electronics skills

## Features
* very fast and accurate adaptive PID-Controller for the heater of your espresso machine (heat-up-time about 2 minutes, stability/RMS of ~0.15 Â°C)
* WWW-Interface for control, configuration and tuning
* Telnet-Server for PID status (analogous to serial terminal)
* MQTT-Interface (needs [PubSub-Client][5])
* OTA-Flash enabled (over-the-air, flash firmware via upload in WWW-Interface)
* Serial Interface for testing, debugging
* JSON-Config in internal SPIFFS (uses [ArduinoJSON][2])
* Re-Written auto-tuning-loop to optimize PID parameters
* integrated simulation to test features and functionality
